Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming with Java

This repository contains Java code examples that illustrate the concept of abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP). Abstraction is the process of representing essential features without exposing implementation details, and it is achieved in Java through the use of abstract classes and interfaces.

**
Key Features:**

**Abstract Classes:**

The repository includes an abstract class called Shape that represents a general shape.
Demonstrates how abstract classes allow for the definition of common behavior while leaving specific implementation details to concrete subclasses.

**Interfaces:**

Introduces interfaces such as Printable and Drawable to showcase multiple inheritance and the implementation of specific behaviors in classes.
Illustrates how interfaces provide a way to achieve abstraction by defining a contract for classes to implement.

**Concrete Classes:**

Provides concrete implementations of shapes, such as Circle and Rectangle, which extend the abstract class and implement interfaces.
Highlights how concrete classes leverage abstraction to provide essential functionality without exposing unnecessary details.
How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Explore the code examples in Java to understand the principles of abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces.
Run the examples to see abstraction in action, including calculating the area of shapes, printing, and drawing objects.
